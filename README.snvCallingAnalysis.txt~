== Description

The SNV workflow takes two merged bam files as input (control and tumor sample)
It performs four steps:
1) snv calling
2) snv annotation
3) snv deep annotation
4) snv filter

== Run flags / switches

Switch                      Default Description
runSNVMetaCallingStep       false   Run a single job for snv calling instead of a job per chromosome.
                                    The meta job is optimized in regards to runtime and cpu / memory utilization.
                                    On the other hand it is a larger job which might be more difficult to schedule.
runDeepAnnotation           true    Run the deep annotation step or stop the workflow before it.
runFilter                   true    Run the filter step or stop the workflow before it.
runOnPancan                 false   Run a special analysis type for pancancer type projects.
